# 0x0D-web_stack_debugging_0

This is the first in a series of Webstack debugging series. In this debugging series, I was tasked with fixing a broken/bugged webstack in an isolated container into a working state. I wrote a script automating the command necessary to fix the webstack.

## Task :clipboard:

:zero: Give me a page!
+ [0-give_me_a_page](https://github.com/birhanugebisa/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/main/0x0D-web_stack_debugging_0/0-give_me_a_page): A bash script that runs an Apache on the container and return a paage containing Hello ALX when quering the root of it.
